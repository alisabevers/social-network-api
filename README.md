# Social Network API

## Description
This assignment from the GT Coding Bootcamp required that I created API routes which succcessfully passed the tests through Insomnia. I created GET, POST, and DELETE routes for Users and Thoughts. 

Click on this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hP7uoNp48KEt4TZt5PPnWemV5kQC--N7/view) to see a live demo of the routes being tested on Insomnia.

## Usage
To use this app, simply clone the repo onto your machine and enter the commands into your terminal.

## Installation Commands
* To install the required node modules, enter ```npm i```.
* To open the server, enter ```node server.js```.

## Instructions
* After you run the installation commands, you should be able to test the routes on Insomnia. Make sure you have Insomnia or another routes testing app. Enter the appropriate URL and ensure you are testing for the right kind of Route.
